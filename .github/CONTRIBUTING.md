# Introduction

Thank you for taking a look at open-space-game.  With the help of potential contributors, like you, we hope to make this one of the best SIM-RTS-RPG-FPS games out there ...  This can seem like a daunting task but I'm guessing that's what brought you here in the first place.

There are a number of ways that you can directly contribute, even if you are not a programmer or an artist.  Documents are always needing to be read, re-read and updated as things change with in the project and to correct those pesky grammatical and spelling bugs that seem to creep in.  In addition, tutorials and explanation articles are always welcome, as well as bug related tasks (finding and reporting them, and detailed bug investigations), feature request research and of course we'll take code, art and unity asset submissions as well.

We hope that the following document will help you to better understand how to find something to do, how to go about doing that thing and then how to share that with the rest of the community.  We understand that it's very frustrating having a desire to help out but not knowing where to start or, you know where to start, but lack the detailed instructions for doing something you already know you want to do.

When contributing please take note that we subscribe to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Enterlucent/open-space-game-sandbox/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and we expect all contributors to abide by the code contained.  Please take a moment to review this document if you have not already.  If this is your first open source project you may also wish to read GitHub's [How To Contribute](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) guide.

# Getting Started

In every game studio the tasks are broken down into manageable parts.   Those parts are then worked on by people who have the desire and the talent to get those tasks accomplished.  These tasks often fall into a number of specific roles:

* [Evangelist](#evangelist) - Someone who really loves and understand the work and wants to connect others to it
* [Documenter](#documenter) - Someone who understand the project and wants to help others understand it as well
* Game Designer - Someone who has played a wide number of games and understands how to create game mechanics that others will love
* Game Artist - Someone who has a technical knowledge of how modern video games work but also have been touched by a muse
* Game Programmer - Someone who understand how to implement the concepts proposed by the Game Designers 
* Animator - Someone who is responsible for making things appear to move within a game
* Audio Engineer - Someone who has a great joy for music and wants to spread that joy via a video game
* Quality Controller - Someone who doesn't mind pushing things to their limit and breaking something (if only to make it better!)

There can be many more roles but these are the ones that we will focus on throughout the rest of this document.   

Often people will end up wearing many hats, where an artist might contribute some documentation or provide a crucial bug fix, a programmer might try their hand at some art assets and Documenters might feel the need to evangelize the game.  These roles are in no way meant as a limitation but as a organization tool for work that needs to be performed.

# Evangelist <a id="evangelist"></a>

This is by far the most open-ended of the roles as there is no telling who might find our game fun and become impassioned enough to tell others; and we like it like that.  If you feel the need to express your love for open-space-game then we encourage you, however, there are some things we would rather you NOT do:

## Prohibitions
* **NO LYING** - No providing false or misleading information in regards to open-space-game, it's developers, it's community, those that have contributed, those that will contribute or about anyone or anything that has, currently or will at some future time exist in our shared thee dimensional universe.
* **Post to Appropriate Places** - Do not post information on forums, chat rooms, message boards, mailing lists or any other form of communication in which ideas are transfered from one being to another that is not appropriate to that venue.
* **Respect Other's Disinterest** - If a community doesn't wish to know about the awesome that is open-space-game then do not press or in any way make yourself an annoyance to those who you are evangelizing.
* **NO HYPE** - This is an open source project created by other passionate people who are in no way, shape, or form bound to it in any substantial way other than their own desire to do so (just like you!).   Things will take as long as they take and hype only makes for people getting upset and disappointed (Skyrim Together!!!!!!).

Outside of the above items **you should not do**, feel free to tell everyone far and wide about the virtues of open-space-game and how it can improve their lives.  Also, let developers know that if they too wish to partake in our community that we would very much appreciate anything they have to offer.  Just like yourself, we are all here because of our desire to make open-space-game great and in the end this project is not about the documents, assets or the logic but is about the people and our shared vision.

# Documenter <a id="documenter"></a>

Documenters are not just those chimera who not only have a love for the technical but with the a creative and helpful nature (though that's a good place to start!) and instead is anyone who understands the project and wishes to share that knowledge and has a medium for doing so.  

Often, these skilled people come after a large part of the functionality of the project is complete but this is where open-source projects often diverge from that norm.   It's very likely that the game, over many iterations will change and become more than what it was before, and this will cause the documentation to change.  If this fact does not dissuade you then please read on!  

## Types of Documentation We Need
* Code Level Documentation - This should be performed by the Game Programmers but in the event it is missed or is found lacking, we would love people to add to the code clarity.
* Features and Functions - Documenting how the game works from the most general, "How to Open Open-Space-Game" to the ridiculously explicit "How to Play 12 Copies of Open-Space-Game at Once with Helium Cooled Processors"
* Public Relations - This is how we present ourselves to the world at large.  This includes the web pages, GitHub pages, any promotional material and press releases.
* Tutorials - Show others how to do things that they don't yet know how to do.  These could include trade related articles, videos, local pages or anything else where something unclear becomes more so (clear that is).

## How to Submit Documentation
1. Determine if the documentation already exists that you want to create.
    * Since documentation has the same review standards as logic or assets, one should start by searching the [Issues](https://github.com/Enterlucent/open-space-game-sandbox/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Adocumentation+is%3Aall+)
    * Sometimes things slip through the cracks so if you don't find anything listed in the Issues then you will want to check the [Wiki](https://github.com/Enterlucent/open-space-game-sandbox/wiki) and then [GitHub Pages](https://www.open-space-game.org/)
    * Finally if you would like to try to speak to a real person you can join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/zk3NZEc) server to see if a moderator or channel member can point you in the right direction.
2. Fork the repository for the documentation of need
   	* [Project Documentation](https://github.com/Enterlucent/open-space-game-sandbox/tree/master/docs) - https://github.com/Enterlucent/open-space-game-studio
   	* [Wiki](https://github.com/Enterlucent/open-space-game-sandbox/wiki) - https://github.com/Enterlucent/open-space-game-studio/wiki
   	* [GitHub Pages](https://www.open-space-game.org/) - https://github.com/Enterlucent/open-space-game.github.io
3. Make any changes or additions.
	* Check for changes to the base often and pull as needed
4. Submit a pull request that includes just your changes.  
	* Make sure to give it the label of documentation on the pull request.
	* Maintainers may ask questions or request changes so make sure to check back!
