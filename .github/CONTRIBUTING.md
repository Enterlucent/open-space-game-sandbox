# Introduction

Thank you for taking a look at open-space-game.  With the help of potential contributors, like you, we hope to make this one of the best SIM-RTS-RPG-FPS games out there ...  This can seem like a daunting task but I'm guessing that's what brought you here in the first place.

There are a number of ways that you can directly contribute, even if you are not a programmer or an artist.  Documents are always needing to be read, re-read and updated as things change with in the project and to correct those pesky grammatical and spelling bugs that seem to creep in.  In addition, tutorials and explanation articles are always welcome, as well as bug related tasks (finding and reporting them, and detailed bug investigations), feature request research and of course we'll take code, art and unity asset submissions as well.

We hope that the following document will help you to better understand how to find something to do, how to go about doing that thing and then how to share that with the rest of the community.  We understand that it's very frustrating having a desire to help out but not knowing where to start or, you know where to start, but lack the detailed instructions for doing something you already know you want to do.

When contributing please take note that we subscribe to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Enterlucent/open-space-game-sandbox/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and we expect all contributors to abide by the code contained.  Please take a moment to review this document if you have not already.

# Getting Started

In every game studio the tasks are broken down into manageable parts.   Those parts are then worked on by people who have the desire and the talent to get those tasks performed.  These tasks often fall into a number of set roles:

* Evangelist - Someone who really loves and understand the work and wants to connect others to it
* Documenter - Someone who understand the project and wants to help others understand it as well
* Game Designer - Someone who has played a wide number of games and understands how to create game mechanics that others will love
* Game Artist - Someone who has a technical knowledge of how modern video games work but also have been touched by a muse
* Game Programmer - Someone who understand how to implement the concepts proposed by the Game Designers 
* Animator - Someone who is responsible for making things appear to move within a game
* Audio Engineer - Someone who has a great joy for music and wants to spread that joy via a video game
* Quality Controller - Someone who doesn't mind pushing things to their limit and breaking something (if only to make it better!)

There can be many more roles but these are the ones that we will focus on throughout the rest of this document.   Often people will end up wearing many hats, where an artist might contribute some documentation or provide a crucial bug fix, a programmer might try their hand at some art assets and Documenters might feel the need to evangelize the game.  These roles are in no way meant as a limitation but as a organization tool for work that needs to be performed.
